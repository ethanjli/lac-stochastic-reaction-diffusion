# CS 279 Final Project: Reaction-Diffusion Simulation of *lac* Operon Induction

This project used existing programs without any software implementation.

## Required Software Packages
This project requires a Python distribution with matplotlib, an installation of Blender, an MCell binary, and the CellBlender plugin for Blender. Instructions for setting up MCell and CellBlender can be found [here](http://www.mcell.org/tutorials/install_mcell.html#mcell-install) (for MCell),  [here](http://www.mcell.org/tutorials/install_cellblender.html#cellblender-install), and [here](http://www.mcell.org/tutorials/first_time.html#first-time) (in that order, for CellBlender).

## Usage
The various `.blend` files in this project can be opened in Blender. Simulations were set up and run in the `CellBlender` panel and visualized in Blender. Plots were generated through CellBlender in the `Plot Output Settings` sub-panel.
